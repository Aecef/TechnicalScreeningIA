    Assumptions:
        Output File does not need to keep track of the date when the letters come in. 
            - Upon further reading, it may be helpful to put the files in a dated folder 
              to help keep reports near the changed files.
        There will be more admission letters than scholarship letters.
        Will assume the user can use the console.
        All of the files will be in correct format 
        This program will always be used in Iowa (CST)
